# Social Media UI Clone (2023 Archive)

This is a historical Project:**Preserved as an archive of my very first code, written at age 15.
> **Built in:** 2023 | **Status:** Archived

--Project Overview--
This was my first attempt at reverse engineering a major platform (Facebook).
I challenged myself to recreate the 2023 Desktop UI pixel-by-pixel using only HTML & CSS (no libraries).

--Technical Highlights--
Extensive use of CSS Flexbox and Grid.
Manual handling of image sprites and icons.
Built a collapsible navigation menu from scratch.
