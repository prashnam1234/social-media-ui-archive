# Social Media UI Clone (2023 Archive)

> 🏛️ **Historical Project:**Preserved as an archive of my very first code, written at age 15.
> **Built:** 2023 | **Status:** Archived

### 📝 Project Overview
This was my first attempt at reverse engineering a major platform (Facebook).
I challenged myself to recreate the 2023 Desktop UI pixel-by-pixel using only HTML & CSS (no libraries).

**Technical Highlights:**
Extensive use of CSS Flexbox and Grid.
Manual handling of image sprites and icons.
Built a collapsible navigation menu from scratch.

### 🚧 Retrospective
*Looking back at this code from 2026:*
The naming conventions (e.g., `messanger`) and file structure are raw, but they represent my learning curve before I adopted modern standards like React and BEM.
